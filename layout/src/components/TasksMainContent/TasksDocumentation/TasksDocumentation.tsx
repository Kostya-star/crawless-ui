          Google Search is the front door to the internet for most people around
          the world, therefore it's really important for businesses how they
          rank on Google. Unfortunately, Google Search does not provide a public
          API, so the only way to monitor search results and ranking is to use
          web scraping.

          Search engine optimization (SEO) — Monitor how your website performs
          on Google for certain queries over time. Analyze displayed ads for a
          given set of keywords. Monitor your competition in both organic and
          paid results. Build a URL list for certain keywords. This is useful if
          you, for example, need good relevant starting points when scraping web
          pages containing specific phrases. Read more in the How to scrape
